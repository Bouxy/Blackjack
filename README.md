Is someone bored ?? if yes, you can test this one.
After I finished the second chapter of the JavaScript course, I thought I'll upgrade the game a bit...and honestly, I never have thought that I will end up with that.

There is no animations, so if don't know the real game, it is maybe a bit hard to understand. (animations is the next step).
(If you inspect the code, you will maybe find some french words)

PS : The design was thought for mobile devices but...it seems not as easy to make a "web game" for mobile. If someone know an easy way to help me, I'll take it.
